    Analyze a directory or repository and create a text dump of its contents.

    This command analyzes the contents of a specified source directory or repository,
    applies custom include and exclude patterns, and generates a text summary of the analysis
    which is then written to an output file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : str
        The source directory or repository to analyze.
    output : str | None
        The path where the output file will be written. If not specified, the output will be written
        to a file named `<repo_name>.txt` in the current directory.
    max_size : int
        The maximum file size to process, in bytes. Files larger than this size will be ignored.
    exclude_pattern : tuple[str, ...]
        A tuple of patterns to exclude during the analysis. Files matching these patterns will be ignored.
    include_pattern : tuple[str, ...]
        A tuple of patterns to include during the analysis. Only files matching these patterns will be processed.

    Raises
    ------
    Abort
        If there is an error during the execution of the command, this exception is raised to abort the process.
